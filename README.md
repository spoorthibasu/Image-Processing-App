# Image-Processing-App
Various techniques used for Image Processing. The techniques include:

 * Zooming In - downsampling an image
 * Zooming Out - upsampling an image. Algorithms implemented are:
   * Nearest Neighbor
   * Linear Interpolation in the x direction
   * Linear Interpolation in the y direction
   * Bilinear
